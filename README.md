# Minimalistic To Do List 
This is a to-do list website with a minimalist style. ThisÂ approach attempts to decrease users' overstimulation when they come across a to-do list application that offers them more features than they require. It was made with HTML, JavaScript, and vanilla CSS for styling. It has the following features: 
* Adding new tasks,
* Delete existing tasks,
* Saves completed and deleted tasks for future reference,
* and recovering deleted tasks.

This idea and its implementation are my own, and no one else may use it without my consent.
